# To use this script, set SILVER_HOME below to where Silver is installed,
# and place this file (with executable bit set) somewhere in your PATH.

# Set this to wherever the jar files for silver are:
SILVER_HOME=../jars/

# This is the only thing that NEEDS to be done to use this script.




# This is set automatically by RunSilver.jar.  You can also overwrite this with the -G flag
#SILVER_GEN=$SILVER_HOME/../generated

# Bug note: RunSilver.jar wants this to be writable, and passing -G doesn't satisfy this requirement.

# Also set automatically by RunSilver.jar.  You can also add to this with the -I flag
# Changing this will override the automatic setting shown.
