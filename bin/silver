# To use this script,
# 1. set the SILVER_HOME environment variable to the directory in
#    which Silver is installed.  This is the directory that contains 
#    the bin, jars, and generated directories.
#
#    This may be done in your appropriate login scripts, for example,
#    .bashrc if you use the bash shell, or by unncommenting and
#    completing the assignment statement below:
#
# SILVER_HOME=<where you have installed Silver>
#
# 2. set your PATH envrionment variable to include this directory,
#    $SILVER_HOME/bin.

#### should be
#### java -Xmx2000M -Xss4M -jar $SILVER_HOME/jars/RunSilver.jar $@ && ant

#### currently is
java -Xmx2000M -Xss4M -jar $SILVER_HOME/RunSilver.jar $@ && ant

# If your are compiling large grammars you may need to adjust the Java
# heap size by changing the -Xmx argument or adjust the Java stack space
# by changing the -Xss argument.





############## Besides the java command, which uses the current
############## version of $SILVER_HOME the above is what this file
############## should contain.  I do think $SILVER_HOME should point
############## to the directory above jars however.  Why point to
############## something inside that is of no interest to users.


############## Old stuff below - Ted, please remove once you verify it is
############## no longer needed.





# Set this to wherever the jar files for silver are:
##SILVER_HOME=../jars/

# This is the only thing that NEEDS to be done to use this script.




# This is set automatically by RunSilver.jar.  You can also overwrite this with the -G flag
#SILVER_GEN=$SILVER_HOME/../generated

# Bug note: RunSilver.jar wants this to be writable, and passing -G doesn't satisfy this requirement.

# Also set automatically by RunSilver.jar.  You can also add to this with the -I flag
# Changing this will override the automatic setting shown.
#GRAMMAR_PATH=$SILVER_HOME/../grammars/:.

# java -Xmx2000M -Xss4M -jar $SILVER_HOME/RunSilver.jar $@ && ant

# Adjust -Xmx (heap space) and -Xss (stack space) if you have issues with these running out.
