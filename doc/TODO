CHECK collection attributes - NPE is generated if the defines
   statement is not defined :=

BuildProcess should create a MEta nonterminal giving it the Command - it produces commonly used things like sereachpaths, grammarpaths, grammarname and such.  pass that around so you don't need to keep recomputing it.

fix syntax production foo, functin foo, concrete production foo

---

to check for multiple declarations there should be an env lookup that lookups to the first one - not just the first scope, and not all scopes.  currently we use the all scopes one (look at occurs dcl);


exprs should all forward to a default expr.  that way things like isProductionReference can be defaulted on thoes productions that are not productionreferences.  also userFriendly and other things.
