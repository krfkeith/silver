This extension is not used in the expr:composed:expr_all composed
language since this extension extends expr:host:op_overloading and
not expr:host that is used in expr_all.

The grammars
  expr:host:op_overloading
  expr:exts:float
  expr:composed:expr_float
are provided to illustrate how operator overloading works in the
extensible Java specifications in ableJ and in other language
specifications.  

Since this expression grammar is used for tutorials, we decided to
keep the host language as simple as possible and that led us to leave
operator overloading out of the host language.
