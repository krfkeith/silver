Each of the tutorials has a compile script that, when run from the directory
it is in, should build the grammar with no special configuration necessary.

These are:

hello/silver-compile
dc/silver-compile
turing/silver-compile
simple/host/silver-compile
simple/with_implication/silver-compile
simple/with_repeat_until/silver-compile
simple/with_all/silver-compile

See the tutorial documentation for more information.
